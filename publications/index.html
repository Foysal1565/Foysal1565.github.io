            <p>Recent advances in Wi-Fi sensing have ushered in a plethora of pervasive applications in home surveillance, remote healthcare, road safety, and home entertainment, among others. Most of the existing works are limited to the activity classification of a single human subject at a given time. Conversely, a more realistic scenario is to achieve simultaneous, multi-subject activity classification. The first key challenge in that context is that the number of classes grows exponentially with the number of subjects and activities. Moreover, it is known that Wi-Fi sensing systems struggle to adapt to new environments and subjects. To address both issues, we propose SiMWiSense, the first framework for simultaneous multi-subject activity classification based on Wi-Fi that generalizes to multiple environments and subjects. We address the scalability issue by using the Channel State Information (CSI) computed from the device positioned closest to the subject. We experimentally prove this intuition by confirming that the best accuracy is experienced when the CSI computed by the transceiver positioned closest to the subject is used for classification. To address the generalization issue, we develop a brand-new few-shot learning algorithm named Feature Reusable Embedding Learning (FREL). Through an extensive data collection campaign in 3 different environments and 3 subjects performing 20 different activities simultaneously, we demonstrate that SiMWiSense achieves classification accuracy of up to 97%, while FREL improves the accuracy by 85% in comparison to a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and up to 20% when compared to the state-of-the-art few-shot embedding learning (FSEL), by using only 15 seconds of additional data for each class. For reproducibility purposes, we share our 1 TB dataset and code repository: https://github.com/kfoysalhaque/SiMWiSense</p>

            <p>Recently, researchers have shown that the beamforming feedback angles (BFAs) used for Wi-Fi multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) operations can be effectively leveraged as a proxy of the channel frequency response (CFR) for different purposes. Examples are passive human activity recognition and device fingerprinting. However, even though the BFAs report frames are sent in clear text, there is not yet a unified open-source tool to extract and decode the BFAs from the frames. To fill this gap, we developed Wi-BFI, the first tool that allows retrieving Wi-Fi BFAs and reconstructing the beamforming feedback information (BFI) – a compressed representation of the CFR – from the BFAs frames captured over the air. The tool supports BFAs extraction within both IEEE 802.11ac and 802.11ax networks operating on radio channels with 160/80/40/20 MHz bandwidth. Both multi-user and single-user MIMO feedback can be decoded through Wi-BFI. The tool supports real-time and offline extraction and storage of BFAs and BFI. The real-time mode also includes a visual representation of the channel state that continuously updates based on the collected data. Wi-BFI code is open source and the tool is also available as a pip package1.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose BeamSense– a completely novel approach to implement standard compliant Wi-Fi sensing applications. Wi-Fi sensing enables game-changing applications in remote healthcare, home entertainment, and home surveillance, among others. However, existing work leverages the manual extraction of channel state information (CSI) from Wi-Fi chips to classify activities, which is not supported by the Wi-Fi standard and hence requires the usage of specialized equipment. On the contrary, BeamSense leverages the standard-compliant beamforming feedback information (BFI) to characterize the propagation environment. Conversely from CSI, the BFI (i) can be easily recorded without any firmware modification, and (ii) captures the multiple channels between the access point and the stations, thus providing much better sensitivity. BeamSense includes a novel cross-domain few-shot learning (FSL) algorithm to handle unseen environments and subjects with few additional data points. We evaluate BeamSense through an extensive data collection campaign with three subjects performing twenty different activities in three different environments. We show that our BFI-based approach achieves about 10% more accuracy when compared to CSI-based prior work, while our FSL strategy improves accuracy by up to 30% and 80% when compared with state-of-the-art cross-domain algorithms.</p>

            <p>The recent development of wireless communications has prompted many diversified applications in both industrial and medical sectors. Zigbee is a short-range wireless communication standard that is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is vastly used in both indoor and outdoor applications. Its performance depends on networking parameters, such as baud rates, transmission power, data encryption, hopping, deployment environment, and transmission distances. For optimized network deployment, an extensive performance analysis is necessary. This would facilitate a clear understanding of the trade-offs of the network performance metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio (PDR), power consumption, network life, link quality, latency, and throughput. This work presents an extensive performance analysis of both the encrypted and unencrypted Zigbee with the stated metrics in a real-world testbed, deployed in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The major contributions of this work include (i) evaluating the most optimized transmission power level of Zigbee, considering packet delivery ratio and network lifetime; (ii) formulating an algorithm to find the network lifetime from the measured current consumption of packet transmission; and (iii) identifying and quantizing the trade-offs of the multi-hop communication and data encryption with latency, transmission range, and throughput.</p>

            <p>Neural networks have made big strides in image classification. Convolutional neural
  networks (CNN) work successfully to run neural networks on direct images. Handwritten character
  recognition (HCR) is now a very powerful tool to detect traffic signals, translate language, and extract
  information from documents, etc. Although handwritten character recognition technology is in
  use in the industry, present accuracy is not outstanding, which compromises both performance and
  usability. Thus, the character recognition technologies in use are still not very reliable and need further
  improvement to be extensively deployed for serious and reliable tasks. On this account, characters
  of the English alphabet and digit recognition are performed by proposing a custom-tailored CNN
  model with two different datasets of handwritten images, i.e., Kaggle and MNIST, respectively, which
  are lightweight but achieve higher accuracies than state-of-the-art models. The best two models from
  the total of twelve designed are proposed by altering hyper-parameters to observe which models
  provide the best accuracy for which dataset. In addition, the classification reports (CRs) of these
  two proposed models are extensively investigated considering the performance matrices, such as
  precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score, which are obtained from the developed confusion matrix
  (CM). To simulate a practical scenario, the dataset is kept unbalanced and three more averages for the
  F measurement (micro, macro, and weighted) are calculated, which facilitates better understanding
  of the performances of the models. The highest accuracy of 99.642% is achieved for digit recognition,
  with the model using ‘RMSprop’, at a learning rate of 0.001, whereas the highest detection accuracy
  for alphabet recognition is 99.563%, which is obtained with the proposed model using ‘ADAM’
  optimizer at a learning rate of 0.00001. The macro F1 and weighted F1 scores for the best two models
  are 0.998, 0.997:0.992, and 0.996, respectively, for digit and alphabet recognition.</p>

            <p>LoRaWAN is one of the popular Internet of
  Things (IoT) wireless technologies due to its versatility, long
  transmission range, and low power communication capabilities.
  In LoRaWAN, the data from the source to the destination is
  routed through the gateways, increasing the communication
  latency. The higher latency being a barrier in real-time
  applications has prompted researchers to employ the physical
  (PHY) layer of the LoRaWAN protocol -commonly termed as
  LoRa, which utilizes the Device-to-Device (D2D) based
  communication techniques to minimize the communication
  latency. However, an extensive analysis of the D2D-LoRa is
  needed for optimizing and better designing the network, which
  is missing in the current literature. To address the void, this
  paper analyzes the latency performance of the D2D based LoRa
  by varying Spreading Factors (SF) and bandwidths and
  explores the trade-offs with experimental deployment in a 110
  m long indoor environment. The evaluation shows that with SF 7 and bandwidth 500 kHz, the communication latency is
  minimum which is 33.67 ms at 0 m and 53 ms at 110 m for the
  data packet of 13 bytes for each of the cases</p>

            <p>IoT and Machine Learning has improved multi-fold in recent years and
  they have been playing a great role in healthcare systems which includes detecting, screening and monitoring of the patients. IoT has been successfully detecting
  different heart diseases, Alzheimer disease, helping autism patients and monitoring
  patients’ health condition with much lesser cost but providing better efficiency, reliability and accuracy. IoT also has a great prospect in fighting against COVID-19. This
  chapter discusses different aspects of IoT in aiding healthcare systems for detecting
  and monitoring Coronavirus patients. Two such IoT based models are also designed
  for automatic thermal monitoring and for measuring and real-time monitoring of
  heart rate with wearable IoT devices. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a
  Machine Learning algorithm that has been performing well in detecting many diseases including Coronary Artery Disease, Malaria, Alzheimer’s disease, different
  dental diseases, and Parkinson’s disease. Like other cases, CNN has a substantial
  prospect in detecting COVID-19 patients with medical images like chest X-rays and
  CTs. Detecting Corona positive patients is very important in preventing the spread of
  this virus. On this conquest, a CNN model is proposed to detect COVID-19 patients
  from chest X-ray images. Two CNN models with different number of convolution
  layers and three other models based on ResNet50, VGG-16 and VGG-19 are evaluated with comparative analytical analysis. The proposed model performs with an
  accuracy of 97.5% and a precision of 97.5%. This model gives the Receiver Operating
  Characteristic (ROC) curve area of 0.975 and F1-score of 97.5. It can be improved
  further by increasing the dataset for training the model.</p>

            <p>The industrial development of the last few decades has prompt to increase in the number of vehicles multi-fold. With the increased number of   vehicles on the road, safety has become one of the major concerns. Inter vehicular communication, specially Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication     can address these pressing issues including autonomous traffic systems and autonomous driving. Extensive research is going on to develop a reliable V2X   communication architecture with different wireless technologies like Long Range (LoRa) communication, Zigbee, LTE, and 5G. The reliability and           effectiveness of V2X communication greatly depend on communication architecture and the associated wireless technology. In this conquest, a LoRa based   reliable, robust, and low power V2X communication architecture is proposed in this paper. The communication architecture is designed, implemented, and   tested in a real world scenario to evaluate its reliability. Testing and analysis suggest a vehicle in the road can communicate reliably with roadside   infrastructures at different speeds ranging from (10-30) Miles per Hour (MPH) with the proposed architecture. At 10 MPH, a vehicle sends one data         packet of 40 bytes every 27 meters and at 30 MPH, it sends the same data packet every 53 meters with smooth transitioning from communicating with one     infrastructure to another.</p>

            <p>The industrial development of the last few decades has prompted an increase in the
  number of vehicles by multiple folds. With the increased number of vehicles on the road, safety has
  become one of the primary concerns. Inter vehicular communication, specially Vehicle to Everything
  (V2X) communication can address these pressing issues including autonomous traffic systems and
  autonomous driving. The reliability and effectiveness of V2X communication greatly depends on
  communication architecture and the associated wireless technology. Addressing this challenge, a
  device-to-device (D2D)-based reliable, robust, and energy-efficient V2X communication architecture
  is proposed with LoRa wireless technology. The proposed system takes a D2D communication
  approach to reduce the latency by offering direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure
  (V2I) communication, rather than routing the data via the LoRa WAN server. Additionally, the
  proposed architecture offers modularity and compact design, making it ideal for legacy systems
  without requiring any additional hardware. Testing and analysis suggest the proposed system
  can communicate reliably with roadside infrastructures and other vehicles at speeds ranging from
  15–50 km per hour (kmph). The data packet consists of 12 bytes of metadata and 28 bytes of payload.
  At 15 kmph, a vehicle sends one data packet every 25.9 m, and at 50 kmph, it sends the same data
  packet every 53.34 m with reliable transitions.</p>

Detecting Coronavirus positive patients is   very important in preventing the spread of this virus. On this conquest, a CNN model is proposed to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-ray images.     Two more CNN models with different number of convolution layers and three other models based on pretrained ResNet50, VGG-16 and VGG-19 are evaluated     with comparative analytical analysis. All six models are trained and validated with Dataset 1 and Dataset 2. Dataset 1 has 201 normal and 201 COVID-19   chest X-rays whereas Dataset 2 is comparatively larger with 659 normal and 295 COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The proposed model performs with an           accuracy of 98.3% and a precision of 96.72% with Dataset 2. This model gives the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve area of 0.983 and F1-     score of 98.3 with Dataset 2. Moreover, this work shows a comparative analysis of how change in convolutional layers and increase in dataset affect       classifying performances.</p>

            <p>Water covers a greater part of the Earth’s surface. However, little knowledge has been
  achieved regarding the underwater world as most parts of it remain unexplored. Oceans, including
  other water bodies, hold substantial natural resources and also the aquatic lives. These are mostly
  undiscovered and unknown due to the unsuited and hazardous underwater environments for
  the human. This inspires the unmanned exploration of these dicey environments. Neither unmanned
  exploration nor the distant real-time monitoring is possible without deploying Underwater Wireless
  Sensor Network (UWSN). Consequently, UWSN has drawn the interests of the researchers recently.
  This vast underwater world is possible to be monitored remotely from a distant location with much
  ease and less risk. The UWSN is required to be deployed over the volume of the water body to
  monitor and surveil. For vast water bodies like oceans, rivers and large lakes, data is collected from
  the different heights/depths of the water level which is then delivered to the surface sinks. Unlike
  terrestrial communication and radio waves, conventional mediums do not serve the purpose of
  underwater communication due to their high attenuation and low underwater-transmission range.
  Instead, an acoustic medium is able to transmit data in underwater more efficiently and reliably in
  comparison to other mediums. To transmit and relay the data reliably from the bottom of the sea
  to the sinks at the surface, multi-hop communication is utilized with different schemes. For seabed
  to surface sink communication, leading researchers proposed different routing protocols. The goal
  of these routing protocols is to make underwater communications more reliable, energy-efficient
  and delay efficient. This paper surveys the advancement of some of the routing protocols which
  eventually helps in finding the most efficient routing protocol and some recent applications for the
  UWSN. This work also summarizes the remaining challenging issues and the future trends of those
  considered routing protocols. This survey encourages further research efforts to improve the routing
  protocols of UWSN for enhanced underwater monitoring and exploration.</p>

            <p>Waste collection and management is an integrated
  part of both city and village life. Lack of optimized and efficient
  waste collection system vastly affect public health and costs
  more. The prevailing traditional waste collection system is neither
  optimized nor efficient. Internet of Things (IoT) has been playing
  a great role in making human life easier by making systems
  smart, adequate and self-sufficient. Thus, this paper proposes an
  IoT based efficient waste collection system with smart bins. It
  does real-time monitoring of the waste bins and determines which
  bins are to emptied in every cycle of waste collection. The system
  also presents an enhanced navigation system that shows the best
  route to collect wastes from the selected bins. Four waste bins
  are assumed in the city of Mount Pleasant, Michigan at random
  location. The proposed system decreases the travel distance by
  30.76% on an average in the assumed scenario, compared to the
  traditional waste collection system. Thus it reduces the fuel cost
  and human labor making the system optimized and efficient by
  enabling real-time monitoring and enhanced navigation</p>

            <p>Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is an IPv6 routing protocol that is standardized
  for the Internet of Things (IoT) by Internet-Engineering Task
  Force (IETF). RPL forms a tree-like topology which is based
  on different optimizing process called Objective Function (OF).
  In most cases, IoT has to deal with low power devices and lossy
  networks. So, the major constraints of the RPL are limited power
  source, network life time and reliability of the network. OFs
  depend on different metrics like Expected Transmission Count
  (ETX), Energy, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for
  route optimization. In this work, the ETX and Energy based OF
  have been evaluated in terms of energy-efficiency and reliability.
  For one sink and nine senders, the simulated average power
  consumption is 1.291 mW and 1.56 mW respectively, for ETX
  OF and Energy OF. On the other hand, the average hop count for
  ETX OF is 1.89, which is 3.01 for Energy OF. Thus, ETX OF is
  more energy-efficient but it is not reliable as it takes fewer hops
  with long distances. Moreover, it does not take load balancing and
  link quality into account. However, Energy OF is more reliable
  due to short hops, but it is not energy efficient and sometimes it
  might take unnecessary hops</p>

            <p>Saint Martin’s island is the largest offshore island
  of Bangladesh which is one of the most beautiful tourist spots in
  the world. But as the island is far away from the mainland,
  it is not connected to the main grid of the country. This
  paper proposes an optimized stand-alone green hybrid system
  to supply electricity for the inhabitants &amp; tourists of the island.
  Considering 1000 households for all of its inhabitants and 200
  hotel rooms for tourists, the average daily load is 1135.82
  kWh/day with an annual peak load of 227.76 kW. The aim of
  this paper is to design the most cost efficient optimized standalone green hybrid system which provides zero emission and
  100% renewable fraction. HOMER(Hybrid Optimization Model
  for Multiple Energy Resources) is used to design this system.
  The simulation results show that a hybrid system with 659 kW
  PV array, 3073 strings of batteries, 245 kW converter forms the
  most optimized stand-alone system with COE(Cost of Energy)
  of 0.266 and NPC(Net Present Cost) of 1379832. Significantly,
  energy cost of the proposed system is viable in context with socioeconomic condition of the country which will eventually provide
  the power solution maintaining the scenic beauty of the island.</p>

            <p>To meet the increased demand of electricity, PV
  system is being used as home RES (Renewable Energy Source)
  throughout the world. In this paper, a grid integrated PV system
  has been proposed with net metering scheme. A home of 149 sq.
  meter in Dhaka city is considered whose average daily load is
  11.27 kWh/day with an annual peak load of 1.21 kW. According to
  DESCO (Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited), for the span
  of last one year (July, 2017-July, 2018) the monthly electricity
  usage of this home varies from 401-600 units (kWh) with a Cost
  of Energy (COE) of $0.1. Simulation and analysis of the proposed
  system shows that the Cost of Energy (COE) and Net present Cost
  (NPC) of the proposed system can be reduced to a great extent
  with the application of net metering scheme which also improves
  the renewable fraction of the system.</p>
