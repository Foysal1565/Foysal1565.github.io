  title={Comprehensive Performance Analysis of Zigbee Communication: An Experimental Approach with XBee S2C Module},
  author={Haque, Khandaker Foysal and Abdelgawad, Ahmed and Yelamarthi, Kumar},
  abstract={The recent development of wireless communications has prompted many diversified applications in both industrial and medical sectors. Zigbee is a short-range wireless communication standard that is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is vastly used in both indoor and outdoor applications. Its performance depends on networking parameters, such as baud rates, transmission power, data encryption, hopping, deployment environment, and transmission distances. For optimized network deployment, an extensive performance analysis is necessary. This would facilitate a clear understanding of the trade-offs of the network performance metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio (PDR), power consumption, network life, link quality, latency, and throughput. This work presents an extensive performance analysis of both the encrypted and unencrypted Zigbee with the stated metrics in a real-world testbed, deployed in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The major contributions of this work include (i) evaluating the most optimized transmission power level of Zigbee, considering packet delivery ratio and network lifetime; (ii) formulating an algorithm to find the network lifetime from the measured current consumption of packet transmission; and (iii) identifying and quantizing the trade-offs of the multi-hop communication and data encryption with latency, transmission range, and throughput.},

  abstract={The industrial development of the last few decades has prompt to increase in the number of vehicles multi-fold. With the increased number of vehicles on the road, safety has become one of the major concerns. Inter vehicular communication, specially Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication can address these pressing issues including autonomous traffic systems and autonomous driving. Extensive research is going on to develop a reliable V2X communication architecture with different wireless technologies like Long Range (LoRa) communication, Zigbee, LTE, and 5G. The reliability and effectiveness of V2X communication greatly depend on communication architecture and the associated wireless technology. In this conquest, a LoRa based reliable, robust, and low power V2X communication architecture is proposed in this paper. The communication architecture is designed, implemented, and tested in a real world scenario to evaluate its reliability. Testing and analysis suggest a vehicle in the road can communicate reliably with roadside infrastructures at different speeds ranging from (10-30) Miles per Hour (MPH) with the proposed architecture. At 10 MPH, a vehicle sends one data packet of 40 bytes every 27 meters and at 30 MPH, it sends the same data packet every 53 meters with smooth transitioning from communicating with one infrastructure to another.},

  abstract={Neural networks have made big strides in image classification. Convolutional neural
  networks (CNN) work successfully to run neural networks on direct images. Handwritten character
  recognition (HCR) is now a very powerful tool to detect traffic signals, translate language, and extract
  information from documents, etc. Although handwritten character recognition technology is in
  use in the industry, present accuracy is not outstanding, which compromises both performance and
  usability. Thus, the character recognition technologies in use are still not very reliable and need further
  improvement to be extensively deployed for serious and reliable tasks. On this account, characters
  of the English alphabet and digit recognition are performed by proposing a custom-tailored CNN
  model with two different datasets of handwritten images, i.e., Kaggle and MNIST, respectively, which
  are lightweight but achieve higher accuracies than state-of-the-art models. The best two models from
  the total of twelve designed are proposed by altering hyper-parameters to observe which models
  provide the best accuracy for which dataset. In addition, the classification reports (CRs) of these
  two proposed models are extensively investigated considering the performance matrices, such as
  precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score, which are obtained from the developed confusion matrix
  (CM). To simulate a practical scenario, the dataset is kept unbalanced and three more averages for the
  F measurement (micro, macro, and weighted) are calculated, which facilitates better understanding
  of the performances of the models. The highest accuracy of 99.642% is achieved for digit recognition,
  with the model using ‘RMSprop’, at a learning rate of 0.001, whereas the highest detection accuracy
  for alphabet recognition is 99.563%, which is obtained with the proposed model using ‘ADAM’
  optimizer at a learning rate of 0.00001. The macro F1 and weighted F1 scores for the best two models
  are 0.998, 0.997:0.992, and 0.996, respectively, for digit and alphabet recognition.},

  abstract={LoRaWAN is one of the popular Internet of
  Things (IoT) wireless technologies due to its versatility, long
  transmission range, and low power communication capabilities.
  In LoRaWAN, the data from the source to the destination is
  routed through the gateways, increasing the communication
  latency. The higher latency being a barrier in real-time
  applications has prompted researchers to employ the physical
  (PHY) layer of the LoRaWAN protocol -commonly termed as
  LoRa, which utilizes the Device-to-Device (D2D) based
  communication techniques to minimize the communication
  latency. However, an extensive analysis of the D2D-LoRa is
  needed for optimizing and better designing the network, which
  is missing in the current literature. To address the void, this
  paper analyzes the latency performance of the D2D based LoRa
  by varying Spreading Factors (SF) and bandwidths and
  explores the trade-offs with experimental deployment in a 110
  m long indoor environment. The evaluation shows that with SF 7 and bandwidth 500 kHz, the communication latency is
  minimum which is 33.67 ms at 0 m and 53 ms at 110 m for the
  data packet of 13 bytes for each of the cases},

  abstract={IoT and Machine Learning has improved multi-fold in recent years and
  they have been playing a great role in healthcare systems which includes detecting, screening and monitoring of the patients. IoT has been successfully detecting
  different heart diseases, Alzheimer disease, helping autism patients and monitoring
  patients’ health condition with much lesser cost but providing better efficiency, reliability and accuracy. IoT also has a great prospect in fighting against COVID-19. This
  chapter discusses different aspects of IoT in aiding healthcare systems for detecting
  and monitoring Coronavirus patients. Two such IoT based models are also designed
  for automatic thermal monitoring and for measuring and real-time monitoring of
  heart rate with wearable IoT devices. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a
  Machine Learning algorithm that has been performing well in detecting many diseases including Coronary Artery Disease, Malaria, Alzheimer’s disease, different
  dental diseases, and Parkinson’s disease. Like other cases, CNN has a substantial
  prospect in detecting COVID-19 patients with medical images like chest X-rays and
  CTs. Detecting Corona positive patients is very important in preventing the spread of
  this virus. On this conquest, a CNN model is proposed to detect COVID-19 patients
  from chest X-ray images. Two CNN models with different number of convolution
  layers and three other models based on ResNet50, VGG-16 and VGG-19 are evaluated with comparative analytical analysis. The proposed model performs with an
  accuracy of 97.5% and a precision of 97.5%. This model gives the Receiver Operating
  Characteristic (ROC) curve area of 0.975 and F1-score of 97.5. It can be improved
  further by increasing the dataset for training the model.},
