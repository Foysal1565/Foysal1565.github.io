  abstract={The recent development of wireless communications has prompted many diversified applications in both industrial and medical sectors. Zigbee is a short-range wireless communication standard that is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is vastly used in both indoor and outdoor applications. Its performance depends on networking parameters, such as baud rates, transmission power, data encryption, hopping, deployment environment, and transmission distances. For optimized network deployment, an extensive performance analysis is necessary. This would facilitate a clear understanding of the trade-offs of the network performance metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio (PDR), power consumption, network life, link quality, latency, and throughput. This work presents an extensive performance analysis of both the encrypted and unencrypted Zigbee with the stated metrics in a real-world testbed, deployed in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The major contributions of this work include (i) evaluating the most optimized transmission power level of Zigbee, considering packet delivery ratio and network lifetime; (ii) formulating an algorithm to find the network lifetime from the measured current consumption of packet transmission; and (iii) identifying and quantizing the trade-offs of the multi-hop communication and data encryption with latency, transmission range, and throughput.},

  abstract={The industrial development of the last few decades has prompt to increase in the number of vehicles multi-fold. With the increased number of vehicles on the road, safety has become one of the major concerns. Inter vehicular communication, specially Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication can address these pressing issues including autonomous traffic systems and autonomous driving. Extensive research is going on to develop a reliable V2X communication architecture with different wireless technologies like Long Range (LoRa) communication, Zigbee, LTE, and 5G. The reliability and effectiveness of V2X communication greatly depend on communication architecture and the associated wireless technology. In this conquest, a LoRa based reliable, robust, and low power V2X communication architecture is proposed in this paper. The communication architecture is designed, implemented, and tested in a real world scenario to evaluate its reliability. Testing and analysis suggest a vehicle in the road can communicate reliably with roadside infrastructures at different speeds ranging from (10-30) Miles per Hour (MPH) with the proposed architecture. At 10 MPH, a vehicle sends one data packet of 40 bytes every 27 meters and at 30 MPH, it sends the same data packet every 53 meters with smooth transitioning from communicating with one infrastructure to another.},
