  title={Comprehensive Performance Analysis of Zigbee Communication: An Experimental Approach with XBee S2C Module},
  author={Haque, Khandaker Foysal and Abdelgawad, Ahmed and Yelamarthi, Kumar},
  abstract={The recent development of wireless communications has prompted many diversified applications in both industrial and medical sectors. Zigbee is a short-range wireless communication standard that is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is vastly used in both indoor and outdoor applications. Its performance depends on networking parameters, such as baud rates, transmission power, data encryption, hopping, deployment environment, and transmission distances. For optimized network deployment, an extensive performance analysis is necessary. This would facilitate a clear understanding of the trade-offs of the network performance metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio (PDR), power consumption, network life, link quality, latency, and throughput. This work presents an extensive performance analysis of both the encrypted and unencrypted Zigbee with the stated metrics in a real-world testbed, deployed in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The major contributions of this work include (i) evaluating the most optimized transmission power level of Zigbee, considering packet delivery ratio and network lifetime; (ii) formulating an algorithm to find the network lifetime from the measured current consumption of packet transmission; and (iii) identifying and quantizing the trade-offs of the multi-hop communication and data encryption with latency, transmission range, and throughput.},

  abstract={The industrial development of the last few decades has prompt to increase in the number of vehicles multi-fold. With the increased number of   vehicles on the road, safety has become one of the major concerns. Inter vehicular communication, specially Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication     can address these pressing issues including autonomous traffic systems and autonomous driving. Extensive research is going on to develop a reliable V2X   communication architecture with different wireless technologies like Long Range (LoRa) communication, Zigbee, LTE, and 5G. The reliability and           effectiveness of V2X communication greatly depend on communication architecture and the associated wireless technology. In this conquest, a LoRa based   reliable, robust, and low power V2X communication architecture is proposed in this paper. The communication architecture is designed, implemented, and   tested in a real world scenario to evaluate its reliability. Testing and analysis suggest a vehicle in the road can communicate reliably with roadside   infrastructures at different speeds ranging from (10-30) Miles per Hour (MPH) with the proposed architecture. At 10 MPH, a vehicle sends one data         packet of 40 bytes every 27 meters and at 30 MPH, it sends the same data packet every 53 meters with smooth transitioning from communicating with one     infrastructure to another.},

  abstract={Neural networks have made big strides in image classification. Convolutional neural
  networks (CNN) work successfully to run neural networks on direct images. Handwritten character
  recognition (HCR) is now a very powerful tool to detect traffic signals, translate language, and extract
  information from documents, etc. Although handwritten character recognition technology is in
  use in the industry, present accuracy is not outstanding, which compromises both performance and
  usability. Thus, the character recognition technologies in use are still not very reliable and need further
  improvement to be extensively deployed for serious and reliable tasks. On this account, characters
  of the English alphabet and digit recognition are performed by proposing a custom-tailored CNN
  model with two different datasets of handwritten images, i.e., Kaggle and MNIST, respectively, which
  are lightweight but achieve higher accuracies than state-of-the-art models. The best two models from
  the total of twelve designed are proposed by altering hyper-parameters to observe which models
  provide the best accuracy for which dataset. In addition, the classification reports (CRs) of these
  two proposed models are extensively investigated considering the performance matrices, such as
  precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score, which are obtained from the developed confusion matrix
  (CM). To simulate a practical scenario, the dataset is kept unbalanced and three more averages for the
  F measurement (micro, macro, and weighted) are calculated, which facilitates better understanding
  of the performances of the models. The highest accuracy of 99.642% is achieved for digit recognition,
  with the model using ‘RMSprop’, at a learning rate of 0.001, whereas the highest detection accuracy
  for alphabet recognition is 99.563%, which is obtained with the proposed model using ‘ADAM’
  optimizer at a learning rate of 0.00001. The macro F1 and weighted F1 scores for the best two models
  are 0.998, 0.997:0.992, and 0.996, respectively, for digit and alphabet recognition.},

  In LoRaWAN, the data from the source to the destination is

  latency. The higher latency being a barrier in real-time
  applications has prompted researchers to employ the physical
  (PHY) layer of the LoRaWAN protocol -commonly termed as
  LoRa, which utilizes the Device-to-Device (D2D) based
  communication techniques to minimize the communication
  latency. However, an extensive analysis of the D2D-LoRa is

  is missing in the current literature. To address the void, this
  paper analyzes the latency performance of the D2D based LoRa
  by varying Spreading Factors (SF) and bandwidths and

  title={Advancement of routing protocols and applications of underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN)—A survey},
  abstract={Water covers a greater part of the Earth’s surface. However, little knowledge has been
  achieved regarding the underwater world as most parts of it remain unexplored. Oceans, including
  other water bodies, hold substantial natural resources and also the aquatic lives. These are mostly
  undiscovered and unknown due to the unsuited and hazardous underwater environments for
  the human. This inspires the unmanned exploration of these dicey environments. Neither unmanned
  exploration nor the distant real-time monitoring is possible without deploying Underwater Wireless
  Sensor Network (UWSN). Consequently, UWSN has drawn the interests of the researchers recently.
  This vast underwater world is possible to be monitored remotely from a distant location with much
  ease and less risk. The UWSN is required to be deployed over the volume of the water body to
  monitor and surveil. For vast water bodies like oceans, rivers and large lakes, data is collected from
  the different heights/depths of the water level which is then delivered to the surface sinks. Unlike
  terrestrial communication and radio waves, conventional mediums do not serve the purpose of
  underwater communication due to their high attenuation and low underwater-transmission range.
  Instead, an acoustic medium is able to transmit data in underwater more efficiently and reliably in
  comparison to other mediums. To transmit and relay the data reliably from the bottom of the sea
  to the sinks at the surface, multi-hop communication is utilized with different schemes. For seabed
  to surface sink communication, leading researchers proposed different routing protocols. The goal
  of these routing protocols is to make underwater communications more reliable, energy-efficient
  and delay efficient. This paper surveys the advancement of some of the routing protocols which
  eventually helps in finding the most efficient routing protocol and some recent applications for the
  UWSN. This work also summarizes the remaining challenging issues and the future trends of those
  considered routing protocols. This survey encourages further research efforts to improve the routing
  protocols of UWSN for enhanced underwater monitoring and exploration.},

  abstract={Zigbee is a short-range wireless communication standard that
  is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is vastly used in both indoor and outdoor
  Internet of Things (IoT) applications. One of the basic constraints of
  Zigbee and similar Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) standards is limited power source as in most of the cases they are battery powered. Thus
  it is very important to optimize the energy consumption to have a good
  network lifetime. Even though tuning the power transmission level to a
  lower value might make the network more energy efficient, it also hampers the network performances very badly. This work aims to optimize
  the energy consumption by finding the right balance and trade-off between the transmission power level and network performance through
  extensive experimental analysis. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) is taken
  into account for evaluating the network performance. This work also
  presents a performance analysis of both the encrypted & unencrypted
  Zigbee with the stated metrics in a real-world testbed, deployed in both

  abstract={Recent advances in Wi-Fi sensing have ushered in a plethora of pervasive applications in home surveillance, remote healthcare, road safety, and home entertainment, among others. Most of the existing works are limited to the activity classification of a single human subject at a given time. Conversely, a more realistic scenario is to achieve simultaneous, multi-subject activity classification. The first key challenge in that context is that the number of classes grows exponentially with the number of subjects and activities. Moreover, it is known that Wi-Fi sensing systems struggle to adapt to new environments and subjects. To address both issues, we propose SiMWiSense, the first framework for simultaneous multi-subject activity classification based on Wi-Fi that generalizes to multiple environments and subjects. We address the scalability issue by using the Channel State Information (CSI) computed from the device positioned closest to the subject. We experimentally prove this intuition by confirming that the best accuracy is experienced when the CSI computed by the transceiver positioned closest to the subject is used for classification. To address the generalization issue, we develop a brand-new few-shot learning algorithm named Feature Reusable Embedding Learning (FREL). Through an extensive data collection campaign in 3 different environments and 3 subjects performing 20 different activities simultaneously, we demonstrate that SiMWiSense achieves classification accuracy of up to 97%, while FREL improves the accuracy by 85% in comparison to a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and up to 20% when compared to the state-of-the-art few-shot embedding learning (FSEL), by using only 15 seconds of additional data for each class.
